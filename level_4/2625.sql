	Description:
		Your company's communications managers want a report on the natural person customer data that is
			registered in the database. But the old report had a problem. customers CPF data came without validation.
		So your job now is to select all the CPFs of all the customers, and apply a mask on the return of the data.
		The CPF mask looks like: '000.000.000-00'.
