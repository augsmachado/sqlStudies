	Description:
		The Mars Technology University has Open Positions for researchers. However, the computer responsible for
			processing the candidates' data is broken. You must present the candidate list, containing the name and
			final score (with two decimal places of precision) of each candidate. Remember to show the list ordered
			by score (highest first).
		The score is given by the weighted average described as:
		
		Avg = (math * 2) + (specific * 3) + (project_plan * 5) / 10
