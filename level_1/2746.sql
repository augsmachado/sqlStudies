	Description:
		Viruses are evolving, but new research has proven that by switching some proteins the vaccine becomes unbeatable.
			The protein H1(Hemagglutinin) when replaced by the X protein (Xenomorphina) has interesting effects against almost
			every viral disease. Some conspiracists say that after the vaccine’s discovery some strange 3 meters tall
			creatures were found in the surroundings of the laboratories, but this is clearly a lie.
		Therefore, you must replace every string “H1”( Hemagglutinin ) by 'X' ( Xenomorphina ).

CREATE TABLE virus (
  id INTEGER,
  name VARCHAR(255)
);


INSERT INTO virus(id, name)
VALUES 
      (1, 'H1RT'),
      (2, 'H7H1'),
      (3, 'HUN8'),
      (4, 'XH1HX'),
      (5, 'XXXX');

  /* Solution */
  SELECT replace(name, 'H1', 'X') AS name FROM virus;
  
  /*  Execute this query to drop the tables */
  -- DROP TABLE virus; --
