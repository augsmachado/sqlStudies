	Description:
		You were hired to be the consultant for a company. Analyzing the database, you noticed that the passwords are
			stored as text files and, as everyone knows, this is a terrible security practice as they are not encrypted.
		Therefore you must convert every password to the MD5 format. Show the client id, the password before conversion
			and the new MD5.
